            <h1> SHADOWHUNTER TAROT CARDS</h1>
        </div>
        <p class="intro">Welcome to Shadowhunter Tarot Cards! These are the worst, and most usless tarot cards because, well, they're fake. Die-hard fans of the Shadowhunter Chronicles will appreciate them I think. Choose a tarot card and get a free (fake) reading of yourself. I actually have no idea how tarot cards work this is strictly for comedic purposes :] </p>

            <p class="firstEmma"> Interesting choice.What drew YOU into selecting Emma? Was it the sword of Cortana? Yeah that sword is a real eye-catcher.Anyways, according to my powers you crave adventure and quarantine was your worst nightmare. Also you are probably a blonde. If you're not a blonde, then you've considered dying your hair blonde but you asked your mom and she said no. You aren't impressed by what you're reading, and you're about to press the reset button so you can peak at the other readings aren't you? </p>

            <p class="secondJulian"> You're probably also an artist, or you want to be, or you wish you were.  </p>

            <p class="lottieText"></p>
            <p class="thirdLottie"> You're going to be a president or in some job being a very bossy person.But thats a good thing!</p>
