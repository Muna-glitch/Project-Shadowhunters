        <p class="intro">Welcome to Shadowhunter Tarot Cards! These are the worst, and most useless tarot cards because, well...they're fake! Die-hard fans of the Shadowhunter Chronicles will appreciate them I think. Choose a tarot card and get a free (fake) reading of yourself. I actually have no idea how tarot cards work this is strictly for comedic purposes :] </p>

            <p class="firstEmma"> Interesting choice.What drew YOU into selecting Emma? Was it the sword of Cortana? I can't blame you. That sword is a real eye-catcher.Anyways, according to my powers you crave adventure and quarantine was your worst nightmare. Additionally, you are very protective of all those you care about. You would do anything to protect them, but many people do not realize this.  </p>

            <p class="julianText"> </p>
            <p class="secondJulian"> You're probably also an artist, or you want to be, or you wish you were. You have artistic aspirations, but you have yet to find the confidence to pursue them or you may be hesitant on sharing them with other people. In the future, you will be completely content with seeing your artwork released into the world!  </p>

            <p class="lottieText"></p>
            <p class="thirdLottie"> You're going to be a president or in some job being a very bossy person.But thats a good thing! Choosing Lottie means you are drawn to being the leader of the group. You are constantly taking initiative in your every day life. Being in the lead is where you come to life.</p>

            <p class="jaceText"></p>
            <p class="fourthJace"> You've been through a lot, including demon possession, but you'll be ok. If you haven't been possessed, you will be :] Kidding. Choosing Jace means that despite all you've been through, you will PERSEVERE! You're future will surpise you in the best ways possible. </p>
